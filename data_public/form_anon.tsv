Some services operate like 'walled gardens' with a lack of links to external sources of information/discussion about music. 2) Maintaining a music streaming library is unreliable because music can disappear from catalog. 3) Music exploration/discovery is current systems is limited to predefined categories within the interfaces that are shaped for majority of users, thus excluding demanding users. There are no tools that would allow to personalize the UI of a music streaming service (e.g., hide a playlist recommendation bar that I do not like, configure what type of metadata to show about music, select a recommendation/search algorithm). 4) Visual representation of releases in such systems is also lacking. Oftentimes, a user cannot fully appreciate artwork as part of the release package.

Moreover, I wish it were easier to create proper music libraries through navigating the likes. I have access to so much music, but I think I was better off downloading songs and checking discographies in a self directed way. Back then this was a necessity, but now with the luxury of streaming I don't do that too much, but this has lowered the quality of music discovery for me.

I couldn't have imagined the flexibility and ease of access we have with regards to music. It's been such a positive change for us. I remember hearing a song on the radio when I was a teenager. Luckily, my dad knew the artist but they didn't have any albums in 'print'. I had to go to the local record shop, find an album that could be sourced and wait 4 weeks for it to arrive, calling in to the record store once a week to ask if it was in. Now I can just click a button, know who the artist is and listen to the track again!

In the other hand I find the 'related artists' section not so accurate, sometimes it is fine, some others it is hard to me to tell what the relationship was between an artist and the other in terms of similarity.   Last comment related, I'm not used to listen to playlists created by others/curators/artists etc. I prefer to start by the most listened songs of an artist (if it is the first time I am listening to it) and then go by albums, since it is a good way for me to discover the side B songs of the artist.

It also lets me speak in other languages when there is no one to talk to. Sometimes I just want to hear myself in that language, sometimes I love a song and want to learn it, sometimes it's purely for practice. It would be interesting to have a 'How are you feeling today?' question to help curate daily mixes.

It's also part of the reason I'm starting to get more into audiophile type things, since that's where a lot of music discovery is easier.

I have tons of playlists, but it's difficult to organize them (hard to create folders, no options to sort playlists by date created - which would be super useful, etc). I feel like while it's easy to explore and discover new music, it's difficult to keep up with the music you already know. Makes it easy to forget about music that you already like.
